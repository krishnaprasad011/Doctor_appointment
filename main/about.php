                <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h2>
                <p class="text-center">The seeds of our origin were sown as early as 1953 when the founder of the Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG), Dr. T.M.A. Pai, established the Kasturba Medical College in Manipal, Karnataka. Manipal Hospitals as an entity came into existence in 1991 with the launch of our 650-bed flagship hospital at Old Airport Road, Bangalore. Today, we are one of India’s leading healthcare 
                    groups with a network of 15 hospitals and have an international presence through our hospitals.</p>
